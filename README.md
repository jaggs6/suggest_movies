# your-celebrity-match

The application uses IBM Watson [Personality Insights][pi_docs] and Twitter to find the celebrities that are similar to your personality. Twitter is being use to get the tweets for a given handler, the text from those tweets is send to Personality Insights, who analyze the text and reply with a personality profile. That profile is compared to celebrity profiles to find the most similar.

The application is running in [Bluemix][bluemix].

## Getting Started

This instructions will help you install the celebrities app in your local environment.

1. Get the code by downloading this [file][code_zip] or cloning the git repository with:

    ```sh
    $ git clone git@github.com:watson-developer-cloud/yourcelebritymatch.git
    ```

1. Install [node][node] (use v0.10.31)

1. Install [mongodb][mongodb]

1. Install the npm modules:

    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```
    **Note:** Make sure you are in the project directory, the `package.json` file should be visible.

1. Start mongodb

    ```sh
    $ mongod
    ```
    (Run this in a separate terminal window)

1. Update the Twitter and Personality Insights credentials in `config/config.js`
    ```js
    {
      personality_insights: {
        url:      '<url>',
        username: '<username>',
        password: '<password>'
      },

      twitter: [{
        consumer_key:       '<consumer_key>',
        consumer_secret:    '<consumer_secret>',
        access_token_key:   '<access_token_key>',
        access_token_secret:'<access_token_secret>'
      }]
    }
    ```

    Instructions on how to create an app and get Twitter credentials [here][twitter_app](you can use more than one Twitter app ;-) ).
1. Start the app

    ```sh
    $ node app.js
    ```

1. Update the database with the celebrities by going to:

    `http://localhost:3000/celebrities/syncdb`


## Personality Insights Credentials
The credentials for the services are stored in the [VCAP_SERVICES][vcap_environment] environment variable. In order to get them you need to first create and bind the service to your application.

There are two ways to get the credentials, you can use Bluemix to access your app and view the `VCAP_SERVICES` there or you can run:

```sh
$ cf env <application-name>
```

Example output:
```sh
  System-Provided:
  {
  "VCAP_SERVICES": {
    "personality_insights": [{
        "credentials": {
          "password": "<password>",
          "url": "<url>",
          "username": "<username>"
        },
      "label": "personality_insights",
      "name": "personality-insights-service",
      "plan": "IBM Watson Personality Insights Monthly Plan"
   }]
  }
  }
```

You need to copy `username`, `password`.

## Celebrities
  The application comes with two profiles: [@germanatt][german_twitter] and [@nfriedly][nathan_twitter]. If you want to add more profiles you will have to:
  1. Choose a person to include as 'celebrity'. You need at least 100 different words writted by that person, blog posts, tweets, text messages, emails will work.
  1. Get the profile by using the [Personality Insights][pi_docs] service with the text you have and save the json profile in the `profiles` folder. Make sure the file has the `.json` extension as in the examples provided.
  1. Start the app and go to: `http://localhost:3000/celebrities/syncdb`. It will repopulate the application database and add the new profile.
